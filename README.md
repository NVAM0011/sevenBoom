# sevenBoom
This is a very simple Java program that I created as a solution to a coding problem I found online. I was looking at some of the simplier challenges for my first project in Java as well as starting to become more familiar with object oriented programming in general.
# The challenge and my solution
The goal of the programming problem is to take a user string and check if it contains a 7. If the string does contain a 7 then the program returns "BOOM!" and if there is not it returns "There is not seven in this string."
